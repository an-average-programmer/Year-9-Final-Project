# Music Quiz Game

A command-line music quiz game written in Python. This project is part of a Year 9 computer tech final project.  
You guess the song title from an artist and a set of initials. You get two chances per song, and your score is tracked.

## Game Overview

When you run the game:
- You are shown the name of an artist and the initials of a song title.
- Your goal is to type the correct song name. You have two tries for each song.
- If you get it right on the first try, you earn 3 points. If you get it right on the second try, you earn 1 point.
- If you get it wrong twice, the game ends and the correct answer is shown.
- You can exit at any time by typing certain commands (like `exit` or `quit`).
- Your score is displayed after each round and at the end of the game.

## Modules and Libraries Used

- **random.py** (built-in Python module):  
  Used to randomly select songs from the list, so that the order is unpredictable and no song is repeated during one game.

---

## Functions Defined

1. **get_initials(song_title)**  
   Turns a song title into a string of its first letters (e.g., "Shape of You" → "S O Y"). Used as the clue.

2. **get_user_guess(artist, initials)**  
   Shows the artist and song initials to the player, prompts for input, and returns what the player types.

3. **play()**  
   The main game function. Handles game rules, selects random songs, keeps score, checks guesses, and runs the rounds until the game ends.

---

## Variables and Constants

### Global Constants

- **SONGS**:  
  A list of tuples. Each tuple is (`song_title`, `artist`). This is the entire database of possible quiz questions.

- **EXIT_COMMANDS**:  
  A list of strings: `["exit", "quit", "q", "ESC"]`. You can type any of these at any input prompt to quit the game immediately.

### Local Variables

- **score** (in `play()`):  
  The player's current score, starts at 0.

- **available_songs** (in `play()`):  
  A copy of SONGS, used to keep track of which songs haven't been used yet. Songs are removed from this list after being asked.

- **song_index** (in `play()`):  
  The position of the randomly selected song in `available_songs`.

- **song_title, artist** (in `play()`):  
  The actual song and artist selected for the current round.

- **initials** (in `play()`):  
  The initials for the current song, generated by `get_initials()`.

- **user_guess** (in `play()` and `get_user_guess()`):  
  What the player types as their guess.

---

## Code Block-by-Block Explanation

### Import

```python
import random
```
- Imports the `random` module, allowing the game to select songs randomly.

---

### SONGS List

```python
SONGS = [
    ("Shape of You", "Ed Sheeran"),
    ("Blinding Lights", "The Weeknd"),
    ... # (many more songs)
    ("Believer", "Imagine Dragons"),
]
```
- This is the list of all possible songs. Each item is a tuple: the first part is the song title, the second is the artist.

---

### EXIT_COMMANDS List

```python
EXIT_COMMANDS = ["exit", "quit", "q", "ESC"]
```
- List of strings. If the player types any of these (case-insensitive) when asked for a guess, the game will end immediately.

---

### get_initials() Function

```python
def get_initials(song_title):
    # Returns the first letter of each word in the song title, separated by spaces
    words = song_title.split()
    initials_list = []
    for word in words:
        initials_list.append(word[0])
    initials_string = ''
    for letter in initials_list:
        initials_string = initials_string + letter + ' '
    return initials_string.strip()
```

**What it does, step by step:**
1. Splits the song title into words.
2. Makes a list of the first letter from each word.
3. Joins these letters together with spaces in between.
4. Returns the result, with any extra spaces at the end removed.

**Example:**  
"Shape of You" → ["Shape", "of", "You"] → ["S", "o", "Y"] → "S o Y" (then made uppercase and spaced: "S O Y").

---

### get_user_guess() Function

```python
def get_user_guess(artist, initials):
    # Prints the artist and initials, then asks the user for a guess
    print("Artist: " + artist)
    print("Song initials: " + initials)
    print("Type", EXIT_COMMANDS[0], "or", EXIT_COMMANDS[1], "to end the game at any time.")
    user_guess = input("What is the song name? ")
    return user_guess
```

**What it does, step by step:**
1. Shows the artist name to the player.
2. Shows the clue (the song initials).
3. Reminds the player how to exit the game.
4. Waits for the player to type a guess, then returns that guess.

---

### play() Function (Main Game Logic)

```python
def play():
    score = 0
    print("Welcome to the Music Quizz")
    print("Try to guess the song name. You have 2 chances for each song. The game ends if you miss both guesses for one song, or if you type 'exit' to quit.")
    print("Your score will be shown after each round.")

    # Copy of SONGS to allow for random selection without repetition
    available_songs = list(SONGS)

    while available_songs:
        # Pick a random song from the list and remove it so it can't repeat
        song_index = random.randint(0, len(available_songs) - 1)
        song_title, artist = available_songs.pop(song_index)
        initials = get_initials(song_title)

        # First guess
        user_guess = get_user_guess(artist, initials)
        if user_guess.lower().strip() in EXIT_COMMANDS:
            print("\nYou chose to exit the game.")
            break
        if user_guess.lower().strip() == song_title.lower():
            print("Correct! You get 3 points.")
            score = score + 3
            print("Current score: ", score)
            continue

        # Second guess
        print("Incorrect. Try one more time.")
        user_guess = input("What is the song name? ")
        if user_guess.lower().strip() in EXIT_COMMANDS:
            print("\nYou chose to exit the game.")
            break
        if user_guess.lower().strip() == song_title.lower():
            print("Correct! You get 1 point.")
            score = score + 1
            print("Current score:", score)
            continue
        else:
            print("Sorry, that's wrong. The song was: " + song_title)
            break

    print("\nGame over! Your final score is: " + str(score))
```

#### Block-by-block breakdown:

1. **score = 0**  
   - Sets your score to zero at the start.

2. **Intro Prints**  
   - Welcomes you and prints out the game rules and how to quit.

3. **available_songs = list(SONGS)**  
   - Makes a new list that copies SONGS. Songs will be removed from this as they are used, so you don't get repeats.

4. **while available_songs:**  
   - Main game loop. Keeps running as long as there are songs left that you haven't seen.

5. **song_index = random.randint(0, len(available_songs) - 1)**  
   - Picks a random index from the available songs.

6. **song_title, artist = available_songs.pop(song_index)**  
   - Removes the selected song from `available_songs` so it can't come up again, and gets its title and artist.

7. **initials = get_initials(song_title)**  
   - Gets the initials for the clue.

8. **First guess:**  
   - Calls `get_user_guess()` to show the artist and initials, and waits for your answer.
   - If you type an exit command, the game ends.
   - If you're correct (ignoring case and spaces), you get 3 points, your score is printed, and the next song is selected.

9. **Second guess:**  
   - If the first guess is wrong, you get one more try.
   - If you type an exit command, the game ends.
   - If correct, you get 1 point, your score is shown, and the next song is selected.
   - If wrong, the correct answer is shown and the game ends.

10. **After the loop (when you quit or get a song wrong twice):**
    - The final score is printed.

---

### Game Start

```python
play()
```
- Calls the `play()` function to start the game when you run the script.

---

## Summary

- The computer picks a random song, shows you the artist and the initials of the song title, and waits for your answer.
- You get two chances for each song. Points are awarded based on how quickly you guess correctly.
- The game ends if you get both guesses wrong or if you decide to quit.
- Your score is displayed after each round and at the end.

---

## Customisation

- Add more songs to the `SONGS` list to increase the game's variety.
- Change the exit words in `EXIT_COMMANDS` if you want different commands to quit.
- Adjust the points in the `play()` function if you want a different scoring system.
